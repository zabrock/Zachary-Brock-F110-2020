# Zachary-Brock-F110-2020

This repo is used by the author for submission of lab assignments as part of the F1/10 Autonomous Racing course at OSU.

I am a member of team Need4Speed as part of this course. Our weekly meeting time is on Wednesday at 10 AM.

The first week's submission requires the ROS serial package as installed via 
```
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-serial
```
where ```<distro>``` is replaced by the ROS distribution being used. The ```vesc``` and ```ackermann-msgs``` packages are also used, but come already installed in the workspace.
